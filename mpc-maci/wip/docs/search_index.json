It is described in this recent work, we will briefly state their properties.\n\nCollaborative SNARK takes as an input a shared witness - i.e. the witness vector to the computation, linearly shared between parties. So, an arithmetic MPC is a natural fit for it (because it, roughly, produces shared witness as its computation trace).\nThis witness is then treated (in MPC) to produce a proof (efficiently - for schemes relying mostly on linear operations and few pairings, notably Groth16 and PlonK).

The witness consists of a new pair of arrays, _A, _S, satisfing the following condition: either _A[i] == _S[i], or _A[i] == _A[i-1]. The second condition can not hold for i == 0.\nThe arrays also are constrained by requirement that A is a permutation of _A, and S is a permutation of _S.\nThe non-MPC algorithm does the following:\n\nSort A, this will be _A. Call an index i \"initial\" if either i == 0, or _A[i] != _A[i-1]. \nFor each initial element, find the corresponding j such that _A[i] = S[j], and set _S[i] = S[j].\nFill in the rest of values.\n\nSearching for elements in MPC is not very efficient, so we use a slightly different strategy:\n\nConsider a disjoint union T=A⊔ST = A \\sqcup ST=A⊔S (we will add an additional parameter to remember from which array an element came from, so T[i].value represents the actual value, and T[i].ext is either 0 or 1).

The field paired is set to 1 exactly for one element from A and corresponding element from S (also, in this phase we could check whether lookup is incorrect if we wanted, which amounts to a situation where the neighboring elements with ext == 0 have different values).\nNow, we order by ext, splitting the arrays back and there move the elements of paired == 1 kind to the left of their respective halves. Upon pairing, and sorting by the first element of the tuple, each paired element of A becomes first in a batch of the elements of equal value (because the sort was stable).\n"},"chapter-1-overview/problem-statement.html":{"url":"chapter-1-overview/problem-statement.html","title":"Problem statement","keywords":"","body":"Problem statement\nStub\nMACI, minimal anti-collusion infrastructure is a voting system, suggested here: https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413 by Vitalik Buterin, and implemented here: https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci.\nWe are aiming to improve it by swapping a singular server for an MPC in such a way that user privacy could be broken only by collusion of parties in MPC.\nOther desired properties - non-coercibility and auditability should still hold.\nWe mainly consider some simmilar settings:\n\nThird party is trying to force user into voting as they please.\nThird party is trying to waste user's voice.\nThird party is trying to buy user's voice.\nUser themselves is trying to sell their voice.\n\nWe assume that a third party can force user into some sort of a MPC protocol.\nSome examples of possible attacks:\n\nThird pary forses user to engage in a 2-party protocol in which user will sign a transaction with unknown content with their private key.\nIf third party can prove that there are at least kkk transactions from the user published on a blockchain, they can force user to provide third party with contents of kkk different transactions, then use 1.1.1. and check if there are such blocks on blockchain. \n\n"},"chapter-4-protocol/server-zk.html":{"url":"chapter-4-protocol/server-zk.html","title":"Witness generation","keywords":"","body":"Witness generation\nHere, we describe the circuit for the external audit, and the process of witness generation.

They publish the encrypted shares. The MPC side then produces the proof of decryption (which is easy to do because the parts of the witness can be constructed by the individual parties).\nShared private key\nIn this case, the client encrypts the vote only once, and MPC does the proof of the decryption. It is less efficient in terms of the MPC work, but can be improved a bit by using different circuit for El Gamal decryption - doing nnn separate scalar products with shares of the private key. This admits an efficient witness, because the scalar multiplication part of the witness is now held by the parties separately.\nOutsourcing KZG input\nThis version is ideal from the MPC standpoint, but puts a very heavy computational load on the client.\nIn this case, the client does 2 transactions for each vote.

In standard MACI, the server decrypts all messages, and processes them, checking correctness as a first step. Computations in MPC are much costlier, so we opt to push a lot of work to the client side. Specifically, the encrypted message is accompanied with a Groth16 zk-proof, which validates that the message:\nDecrypts to a well-formed vote\nThe signature is correct\nThe vote vector is correct for this user\nKeychange is correct\n\n\n\n\nParallel processing. The main bottleneck in the arithmetic MPC is round-complexity, therefore normal sequential processing of votes 1-by-1 is inefficient. Instead, we use oblivious stable sort by key as a main primitive, and custom permutation arguments for the proof.\nAs a funny byproduct, the behavior differs from standard MACI in a subtle way (which doesn't break coercion-resistance). Namely, it is possible to \"time travel\" - for example, the sequence of keychanges K2→K3K_2 \\rightarrow K_3K2​→K3​, K1→K2K_1 \\rightarrow K_2K1​→K2​ ​ correctly changes they key from ​K1K_1K1​ to K3K_3K3​. The keychanges from a single key are still ordered by timestamp, and only the first one is valid, so the normal coercion-resistance mechanism works.\n\nKeychange non-collision. For our approach, it is very convenient that the graph of all key-changes of an individual user is a forest (disjoint collection of trees). We enforce it in a following way:\n\nFirst of all, our keys are not actual keys, and better thought of as \"vote identifiers\", any vote contains normal signature of a public key, and the identifier​ KKK.\nInitial identifier is still set to be ​Kinit=PuserK_{\\text{init}}=P_{\\text{user}}Kinit​=Puser​.\nOn a keychange, new key K′K'K′​ must be obtained as K′=Hash(K,R)K' = \\text{Hash}(K, R)K′=Hash(K,R)​, where KKK​ is an old key, and RRR is supplied by the user. This is checked in the zk-proof provided by the client, and guarantees the impossibility of reaching the same key from two different keys, provided that we use a collision resistant hash function.\n\n\nFor optimisation reasons, we might require the voter to send a pair of transactions: first one registering vote id, and second one with the vote. This is done to enable the following trick: user sends both their part of the PlonK input commitment, and encrypted vote which contains their input, with the proof that these two pieces are in accord.

We always assume that the open functionality does not commit to the shares, unless stated explicitly.\nIn SPDZ, each shared value ​[x][x][x] is normally accompanied with the independently shared value [λx][\\lambda x][λx]​, for a globally chosen unique shared MAC key [λ][\\lambda][λ]. This is used for the integrity checks. We do not use it in the current protocol because we need to produce a zk-proof anyways, and integrity validation does not work in case all parties do collude.\nWe do it (but do not spell it out explictly) in computations in the offline phase, to ensure that every part of correlated randomness is distributed as required.\nPublic values can be multiplied by shared values naively: y×[x]=y[x]y \\times [x] = y[x]y×[x]=y[x], and public value yyy can be turned into the shared value by setting y0=yy_0 = yy0​=y, yi=0 for i>0y_i = 0 \\text{ for } i>0yi​=0 for i>0 .

We have separated the witness generation for the zk-proof audit to the separate subsection, because it is logically independent.\nInput\nServer has a fixed public key PPP in some cryptographic group, implemented over Fq\\mathbb{F}_qFq​. We will assume it is JubJub curve in what follows, but other options are available, depending on the used proof system.\nThe corresponding private key [p][p][p] is linearly shared.\nOn-chain, the sequence of encrypted votes is published; each vote is accompanied with a zk-proof of its validity predicate. The form of encryption is currently discussed, there are few options (encrypting all with El Gamal, using El Gamal for symmetric key and MiMC for the vote encryption, encrypting shares separately, or potentially adding supplementary advice simplifying data transfer to the main circuit) with different tradeoffs w.r.t. MPC work, witness size and client proving work, respectively. This is TBD, we continue this discussion in client side subsection.\nThe individual (decrypted) vote v consists of the following data:\nv.user - an unique id of the sender in the global registry.\nv.from - a 254-bit key (from which this tx attempts to switch)\nv.to - a 254-bit key (to which this tx attempts to switch)\nv.votes[n] - a vote vector\nv.depth - a number in range 0..2128−10..2^{128}-10..2128−1\nThe validity predicate (which needs to be proven client side), says that the vote decrypts to the aforementioned data, and, moreover\n\nProver controls cryptographic identity of v.user.\nv.to == 0 or v.votes[n] == 0 (either tx is a key-switch, or a vote).\n(votes, user) pair satisfies the voting rules.\nDepth satisfies range constraints.\nKnowledge of such R, that(v.to == 0) or v.to == Hash(v.depth, v.from, R).\n(v.depth > 0) or (v.from == init_key[v.user]), where init_key is a set of public initial keys of the users.\n\nThe requirement 555 is such that no valid keyswitches should lead to the same v.to key from different states (together with large key size to prevent hash collisions).\nThe requirement 666 constrains the initial key if we are at depth 0.\nWe also refer to an order of a vote in a list of all votes as v.timestamp, and also add a field v.invalid = 0.\nShared decryption phase\n We assume that all of the data is properly constrained (via public checking of validity predicate proof). After this phase (which depends on the encryption implementation) we assume that decrypted votes are all linearly shared between parties, and proceed to the main part of the protocol.\nWe put them in the shared array vote.\nMain computation\nOur main idea is to only use sorting + local operations for round optimization purposes. During the computation, we will mainly sort the main array vote (and pretend that operations done are in-place to simplify the notation, but we will need some of the computation trace later to construct the witness).\nOne should imagine the set of key-switches of a particular user as a set of trees (starting either from an initial key or from depth > 0). We will also require that every key-switch increases the depth by 1. Note, that because of the non-collision property it should not be possible to have the same v.to field with different v.from or v.depth. Therefore, this graph, indeed, will not have cycles.\n0. Depth compression\nIn this round, we discard all votes with v.depth > total_vote_count. This is done to aggressively optimize amount of sorting rounds. Such votes had no chance to be valid anyways, and we believe an adversarial player can not reveal any useful information using this. In what follows, total amount of votes after this reduction is m.\n1. Key compression\nThis round has two purposes: first, we make the key-size smaller to simplify radix sort, and, second, we ensure that there are no coinciding keys from different users. It is done as follows:\nEvery vote is duplicated, with an additional field v.ext set to 0 and 1 respectively, we refer to this array as vote2. For an extended vote, denote v.main_key() = v.ext*v.from + (1-v.ext)v.to\nv in vote2 is sorted (in order of priority) by v.user > v.main_key().\nIntroduce an array jump of the same size, set jump[0] = 0 and for i from 1 to m-1:\njump[i] = \n(vote2[i].main_key() != vote2[i-1].main_key()) or (vote2[i].user != vote2[i-1].user)\nCalculate the running sum q[i]=∑ij=0jump[i]\\text{q[i]} = \\underset{j=0}{\\overset i \\sum}\\text{jump[i]}q[i]=j=0∑i​​jump[i]. This running sum is constant over the votes that are from the same user and have the coinciding main_key.\nNow, we will set for each i:\nvote2[i].from = vote2[i].ext * q[i] + (1-vote2[i].ext) * vote2[i].from\nvote2[i].to   = (1 - vote2[i].ext) * q[i] + vote2[i].ext * vote2[i].to\nwhich sets the key by which it was sorted to the compressed version.\nNow, we order the vote2 back by timestamp (using revealing sort), and then merge the pairs back:\n\nReveal the vote2[2*i].ext field; if it is 1, do nothing, if it is 0, swap this element with vote2[2*i+1].\nSet vote[i].from = vote2[2*i].from; vote[i].to = vote[2*i+1].to.\n\nThis replaces each key with an element of size no more than ⌈log⁡(m)⌉\\lceil \\log(m) \\rceil⌈log(m)⌉, in such a way that:\n\nSame keys of the same user are mapped in the same compressed versions.\nThere are no other collisions; in particular same keys of different users are mapped to different compressed versions // this never happens normally because initial keys are different, but might be a result of a deliberate attack (an attacker could send a \"hanging\" vote of depth > 0 with arbitrary from key).\n\n1. Initial sort\nThe votes are sorted (in order of priority) by  v.from > v.timestamp (by which they were already sorted, so no additional action is required because sort is stable).\nAfter this, we set vote.invalid = (vote[k-1].from == vote[k].from) for all k>0.\nAfter this round, all votes that have a particular \"from\" key after the first attempt of using such \"from\" key will be invalidated. Note that if the first keyswitch turns out to be invalid later (due to the depth requirement), it will also invalidate further valid keyswitch.\nThe result of the round will be that the tree valid key-switches is now a set of linear paths (\"bamboos\").\n2. The main cycle\nDenote d=⌈log⁡(m)⌉d = \\lceil \\log(m) \\rceild=⌈log(m)⌉. We will need ddd rounds of sorting.\nDenote v.odd(r) = v.depth&1\nDenote v.sort_key(r) = v.odd(r) ? v.from : v.to\nOn r-th round:\nSort v in vote by (in order of priority) v.invalid > v.sort_key(r).\nNow, \nfor i from 1 to m-1:\n    if vote[i].odd(r):\n        if (vote[i-1].depth + 1This results in all votes of odd depth checking whether their left neighbor has the same to field as they have from,  and whether depth actually increases by 1. Then, we basically \"merge\" them, by setting the left neighbor's to field and the vote vector to the to field and the vote vector of the composition, and then invalidating the odd vote.\nThe votes of odd depth which do not find their left neighbor are invalidated without further actions.\nNote: to counter the quirky behavior with \"time travel\", mentioned in the introduction, one needs to add to the check the part ...& (vote[i-1].timestamp . This is not hard to do if needed.\n3. Final calculation\nAt this point, we just need to sum vote[i].votes * (1-vote[i].invalid) over the array to get voting results. In the next part, we will describe the slight modifications needed to produce an auditing zk-proof.\nComplexity\nConcrete estimates here are hard, and they probably will depend on the size of the vote vector; one methodology could be estimating total amount of radix sorts that we need to perform (assuming constant register size). Practically, this will be traded off against RAM size of the server machines, but it at least gives an estimate. We will also roughly estimate from above the size of user_id field as d=⌈log⁡(m)⌉d = \\lceil \\log(m) \\rceild=⌈log(m)⌉.\n\nIn compression phase, we need to sort an array of size 2m2m2m by a key of total size 254+d254+d254+d, and then do one additional revealing sort of size 2m2m2m (which we will promptly ignore in this calculation).\nAfter the compression phase, the fields from and to also have a size ddd. Initial sort, thus, is a sort of an array of size mmm by a key of size ddd.\nMain phase involves ddd rounds in which we sort by d+1d+1d+1-bit sized key (additional bit is for invalid bit flag).\n\nDenoting by rrr the radix sort register bitsize, we need to do (254+d)/r(254+d)/r(254+d)/r radix sorts of size 2m2m2m, and d(d+2)/rd(d+2)/rd(d+2)/r radix sorts of size mmm.\nRound complexity, thus, is (8+n)(256+2d)d/r+d×local_ops(8+n)(256+2d)d/r + d \\times \\text{local\\_ops}(8+n)(256+2d)d/r+d×local_ops, but agressive optimization for rrr is bounded by the exponential blowup in memory requirement.\n"},"chapter-3-subprotocols/obliv-permute.html":{"url":"chapter-3-subprotocols/obliv-permute.html","title":"Oblivious random permutation","keywords":"","body":"Oblivious random permutation\nThe procedure\nThis is the main building block of the oblivious sort.
